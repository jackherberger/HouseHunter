HouseHunter - Predicting prices of Southern California homes 

# How to navigate this repo:

Each branch relates to a different aspect of the project.

`main` is our main code that has our initial classification price prediction model.  
`regressor` is our regresion model for price prediction.  
`cGAN` is our cGAN model that attempts to generate images of houses (Needs some more training).

# Overview

We built 2 different ensemble models to predict house prices of houses in Southern California.  

We first binned house prices into `low`, `medium`, and `high` prices and turned this into a classifaction problem. 

We then predicted house pricing with regression. The models are in `.ipynb` files with markdown sections elaborating on our methods.
